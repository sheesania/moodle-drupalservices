 * Authentication Plugin: Drupal Services Single Sign-on
 *
 * This module is based on work by Arsham Skrenes.
 * This module will look for a Drupal cookie that represents a valid,
 * authenticated session, and will use it to create an authenticated Moodle
 * session for the same user. The Drupal user will be synchronized with the
 * corresponding user in Moodle. If the user does not yet exist in Moodle, it
 * will be created.
 *
 * PHP version 5
